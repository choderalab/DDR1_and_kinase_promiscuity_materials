 * `WT-n-Mutant-Free-Energy-on-WT-tics.py` makes:
    * `defining-line-WT-pro.png` that defines the boundary between DFG-in and DFG-out states
    * the four `countour-MSM-line-*.png` figures
    * `bargraph-MSM-line.png` that summarizes the delG results
 * `WT-dividing-curve.py` makes:
    * `DFG-IN-WT-pro.png` and `DFG-OUT-WT-pro.png` show the probability distribution for these respective states within this landscape
    * `Boundary-WT-pro.png`  shows where the probability shifts from being in one state to the other 
    * `Boundary-fitspline-WT-pro.png` shows a curve fit to the boundary between these states
