 ## 3.RESEEDING_WT_AND_MUTANTS/MSM_Analysis

 * `calculate_mutant_features.py` calculates mutant features then used in:
 * `mutant_MSM_analysis_in_WT_space.py` which calculates the mutant MSMs and HMMs in the WT TICA space (Fig. S4C and Fig. S4E)
 * `WT-n-Mutant-Free-Energy-on-WT-tics.py` makes:
    * `defining-line-WT-pro.png` that defines the boundary between DFG-in and DFG-out states (Fig. S4D)
    * the four `countour-MSM-line-*.png` figures (Fig. 3C)
    * `bargraph-MSM-line.png` that summarizes the delG results (Fig. 3D)
